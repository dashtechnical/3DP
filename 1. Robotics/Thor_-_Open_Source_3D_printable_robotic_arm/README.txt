# Summary

Important Note: I suggest you to go to [Thor GitHub Repository](https://github.com/AngelLM/Thor) in order to download the latest design!

If you are interested in this project, please consider joining [our mail list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/thor-opensource-3d-printable-robotic-arm).

Thor is an Open Source and printable robotic arm with six degrees of freedom, designed using FreeCAD.

Its configuration (yaw­-roll­-roll­-yaw­-roll­-yaw) is the same one that is used on most manipulator robots that currently exist in the market.
In its upright position, Thor is about 625mm and it can lift objects up to 750 grams.
The project started a year ago as my Final Degree Project called "Design and startup of an Open Source and printable 6DOF robotic arm" but a lot of things have changed since the presentation day.

The main purpose of this project was to create a robotic arm that could be used in universities and schools to teach robotics instead of using simulation software or low accurate models. Having this in mind, the final prototype had to be affordable and, of course, Open Source.

If you are interested in this project I'll recommend you to visit the [Hackaday Post](https://hackaday.io/project/12989-thor) where you'll find more details!

UPDATE 27/10/16!: DannyVandenHeuven has made some nice modifications and now some pieces are splitted to be printed easier :). [Check it out!](https://hackaday.io/project/16665-thor-robot-with-addons-and-gui)

UPDATE 21/12/16: Merry Chrismas Gift! I uploaded a ZIP with the last modifications. I really suggest you to go to [Thor GitHub Repository](https://github.com/AngelLM/Thor) and check if there are new modifications!

# Print Settings

Printer Brand: RepRap
Printer: Prusa i3 modified
Rafts: Doesn't Matter
Supports: Yes
Resolution: 0.2mm
Infill: 20%

Notes: 
I have used a 3D printer with 300x220mm of printing area and 0.4mm nozzle.

I used ABS for gears and MotorFix pieces, in this way the steppers' heat dont melt the pieces.
