# Summary

eBay has some great *cheap* 12V 4W LED panels for car interior lights (Search: [48 SMD COB Panel LED T10 Car 12V](http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_odkw=48+SMD+COB+White+Panel+LED+T10+Car+Interior+Panel+Light+12V&_osacat=0&_from=R40&_trksid=p2045573.m570.l1313.TR0.TRC0.H0.X48+SMD+COB+Panel+LED+T10+Car+12V.TRS0&_nkw=48+SMD+COB+Panel+LED+T10+Car+12V&_sacat=0)) - Why not make a couple of lamps for my Prusa 3D printer?

I decided to make a design based on the earlier designed [ClipOn](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1940114) system for the main Prusa frame.
As the LED panel get very hot when used directly on 12V, there have to be a good ventilation grid for cooling.

Design challenge:
- All plastic and easy to print (no screws, etc...)
- As few parts as possible
- Little to no post-processing of finished printed parts (edges, holes, etc.)
- Wires should be integrated in the solution
- Light should be adjustable (direction)

# Print Settings

Printer: Original Prusa i3 MK2
Rafts: No
Supports: No
Resolution: 0.20mm

As the lamp get hot, ABS or PETG is best suited materials. I used ABS.
