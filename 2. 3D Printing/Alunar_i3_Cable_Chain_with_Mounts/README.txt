# Summary

I used the Hictop Prusa i3 but found that I needed everything moved backwards by 10mm so that it did not interfere with the Z rods. My x axis bearing and hot end mount on this printer also needed a different attachment for the carriage as it only uses 2 bolts on the top linear bearing units. Using the spare bearing mount holes I decided to attach the end of the cable chain mount to here. The stepper motor end is pushed back 10mm as well from the original and mounting location is changed to reflect this alteration.

Make sure the chain does not exceed or bump into the parts at the top of your Z axis such as the Knob. You may have to remove a few mm from the max Z height of your machine. I don't print large objects so this was fine for me.  Height now is 165mm from 185mm.

Still testing this piece.
