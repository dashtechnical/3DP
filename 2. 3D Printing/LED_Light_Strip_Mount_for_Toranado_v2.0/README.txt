# Summary

A quickly put together LED light mount utilizing the BLTouch mount on the Toranado v2.0. LED base is sized for a 50mm x 10mm LED strip. I used a strip with 5630 LEDs and is very bright. Heatshrink was used to cover the solder pads and double as a way to hold the strip if the rear adhesive is not reliable. Kapton tape or zip ties work too.

Because of the orientation of the E3D heater block for the left-hand Toranado version there is a high chance the base may warp since it's so close. The right-hand version would be preferred.

Base was printed at 65% infill.
Mount whatever % you want.

Feel free to use this as an idea to create an improved version.
