 [WE WON!](http://www.bocabearings.com/innovation-contest/ContestantDetails.aspx?ProjectID=179)  Grand Prize winner!. Thank You all for the votes and cooperation.     

Nice write up, explains this in more detail [ Here](http://www.3ders.org/articles/20150728-ryan-zellars-shares-designs-for-impressive-mostly-3d-printed-reprap-cnc-machine.html)  

I set out to build a minimal cost CNC Machine with the goal of some basic aluminum capabilities and easily swap out the functionality.

The only special tools needed are a hacksaw, and a drill to for 4 holes.   
   
This can be easily expanded to almost any length, width, and depth depending on rigidity required. Shorter lengths = more rigid.  This is built using hardware store emt conduit (In the US it is sold as 3/4" (ID)), or as an upgrade you can use stainless steel tubing.

 Most woods and plastics should be no problem. I milled Aluminum with a footprint of 23.5in x 32in x 4in.  Aluminum works well https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIYMuYgX0rY

You can switch the spindle out with a drag knife, laser, Extruder, ect, making it a great prototyping multi-tool. By adding length and depth It could easily be used to shape large easily milled things like wood, foam, or plastics. Keep it small for aluminum.

X and Y axis take up about 264mm, so whatever cut area you want your outside dimensions should be that plus 264mm.  

#Electronics  
  
I am using marlin / Ramps 1.4, there are a lot of options if you don't like this combo, grbl, tiny g, ect.  

The X and Y steppers are wired in parallel, just like the z axis is on a 3d printer.  Or in series.
