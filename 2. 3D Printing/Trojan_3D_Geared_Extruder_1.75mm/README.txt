# How I Designed This

There's a lot of extruders around, TOO BIG AND HEAVY!!!.
So i decided to make a smaller one..........
That's all.

## REMINDER!!!!!!!

IF your printer is NOT well calibrated and NOT accurate you will not be able to print successfully the TROJAN EXTRUDER.
The files and the project tolerances are based on my printer which is very accurate, so please be sure to print the Spur Gears first, the bearings should be able to fit with a small pressure(NOT WITH A HAMMER!!).
I will be happy to change the tolerance if required, but i cannot make all happy :-))

# BOM

## List of materials and Links

1)For the "Spur Gear 40-26" you will need: 2 x 684 2rs- (4x9x4mm) radial bearings, remove the support ring.
2)For the idler you will need: 1x 625 2rs-(5x16x5mm) radial bearing plus
I found very useful use the POZY PAN SELF TAPPING SCREWS 2.9x19mm
http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/361393954180 easy and fast 

3)For the hobbed pulley shaft you will need: 2x 625 2rs-(5x16x5mm) radial bearing
4)One piece 16T 5mm bore 0.6 metric module pinion   http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/331445033964
4)One piece 5x46mm precision shaft, (hobbed pulley drive)
6)One piece 4x21mm precision shaft (intermediate spur gear 40/26-T)
7Just ask for the lenght you need to the seller by leaving a message http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/271328896010
8)Link for the hobbed pulley drive (very high quality) http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/221487842821
9)1xNema14 stepper motor 20oz torque, I'm using this one, is not bad http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/121577096859 
10)One 30x10mm fan 12V (heatsink)
11)One 35 or 40x10mm fan 12V (hot-end side) at your choice as both files are provided
12)2x micro-jst plugs for the fans http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/171967381367
13)9x M3x4mm Threaded Round Metal Knurl Thread Insert Nuts Brass for the BodyPart-1 & 2 And the Idler


# Assembly tips

1) The Idler is in 2 parts, after printing just clean the pins and make them fit the small holes for the alignement, then glue with super glue or normal UHU pla glue, they fit perfectly.
Then add the brass knurl nut in the side hole, add some super glue to ensure that will stay in place for a very long time, i used for mine and is very hard to remove after, just be carefull to screw in a bolt in the thread so the glue will not affect the funcionality.

2) For the Hot-End Blower2 fan, you have to remove the original external case of the fan (Will post illustrated instructions soon), soldering the new plug wire to the motor, then glue with superglue the motor to the plastic case.
Is an easy job as inside the plastic case i already provided the centering ring and bore, so you have just accomodate the motor in place and make sure is really in place... just make sure to clean all the old supporting arms from the motor.
3) Same apply to the Heat-Sink_cooler fan support, remove the external case from the 30mm fan and follow the same procedure as the Hot-End Blower
4) The BodyPart need to be completed by adding the brass nuts, if you find some hole a bit too easy to fit just add some super glue, will work great.I can't match all of your printers tolerance, this is just for mine. 
DO NOT PRINT THEM AT HIGH SPEED, YOU WILL GET JUST A BAD JOB!!!!
As you can see from the uploaded pictures they come out very clean and neat, so is up to you to repeat the same job.

# Custom Parts

## Custom parts on demand

Please note:
1)I added the 40/26T Spur Gear MR105.STL file, it fit the MR105 radial bearing which is 4x10x5mm bore.
for now is only the spur gear, soon i will add the other files to make this gear work with the TROJAN.

2)Added the Hotend Blower2 40mm.stl  (for the 40mm diameter fan) as requested.
3)Added the 5mm shaft Gear-cover      Carter-5mm-Axe.stl file
