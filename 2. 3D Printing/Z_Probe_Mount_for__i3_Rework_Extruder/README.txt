# Summary

A simple Z probe mount for 12mm inductive sensors for any Prusa i3 Rework extruder with mounting holes in the base. I created this one for my CharlStruder ( http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:678089 )  which has two additional mounting holes.  

If your extruder base does not have mounting holes you can always drill them. Just remember to make sure the mount is fairly level.  You can also use the existing hole by using longer screws to mount both the extruder and the probe mount.  

It is designed to work with hole spacings up to 32mm.  
The no support version is printable without support but has more limited hole spacing support.   

Depending on the location on your X=0, Y=0 you will need to mount you probe either to the left of to the right so that the sensor is over the bed when you hot end is in the home position. Please select the appropriate model.
