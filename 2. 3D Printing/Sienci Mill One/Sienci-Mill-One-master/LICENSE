The Sienci Mill One was created as an open-source product for the public domain by Sienci Labs.
This was done in order to contribute toward the availability of online resources for creating
and sharing harware, software, and electronics designs pertaining to rapid prototyping
technologies. As an open-source product, the Mill One itself already contains existing open
-source products, making additional contributions in the realm of hardware, software, and
electronics. It contains the following:

        -GRBL firmware
                "GRBL is opensource software that runs on an Arduino Uno that takes G-Code 
                commands via Serial and turns the commands into motor signals."

        -Arduino Uno
                "The Arduino Uno is a microcontroller board based on the ATmega328. It has
                14 digital input/output pins (of which 6 can be used as PWM outputs), 6
                analog inputs, a 16 MHz ceramic resonator, a USB connection, a power jack,
                an ICSP header, and a reset button. It contains everything needed to support
                the microcontroller; simply connect it to a computer with a USB cable or
                power it with a AC-to-DC adapter or battery to get started."

        -Arduino IDE
                "The open-source Arduino Software (IDE) makes it easy to write code and upload
                it to the board. It runs on Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux. The environment is
                written in Java and based on Processing and other open-source software."

        -CNC V3.0 HCARDU0086 Arduino Shield
                "This shield (HCARDU0086) is designed to allow you to control a CNC router or
                milling machine from an Arduino board. It contains 4 driver sockets which allows
                compatible Pololu A4988 driver modules to be inserted (see HCMODU0068 on our
                website) providing the ability to drive 3 stepper motor axis (X,Y, & Z) plus an
                optional 4th auxiliary motor. Additional connectors provide easy connection of
                end stop sensors and control buttons."

        -Pololu A4988 stepper motor drivers
                "This breakout board for Allegro’s A4988 microstepping bipolar stepper motor
                driver features adjustable current limiting, over-current and over-temperature
                protection, and five different microstep resolutions (down to 1/16-step). It
                operates from 8 V to 35 V and can deliver up to approximately 1 A per phase
                without a heat sink or forced air flow (it is rated for 2 A per coil with
                sufficient additional cooling)."

-Hardware

        Disclaimer

        The product user takes on all the associated liability pertaining to the
        operation and performance of the Mill One. The listed “Safety Warnings and
        Guidelines” outline the necessary precautions that should be taken any time
        the machine is operated. Sienci Labs will not be held responsible for any
        damages to property or injury incurred on the operator or bystanders. Sienci
        Labs will not be held responsible for damages to property or injury incurred
        on the operator or bystanders if any alterations are made to the design or
        assembly of our machine. Although care is taken to ensure the accuracy of

        Safety Warnings and Guidelines

        1.  Be sure to carefully follow provided machine assembly instructions before
            machine use to ensure operator safety.
        2.  All wires must be appropriately positioned before beginning the operation 
            of this machine. Cutting a “live” wire may cause exposed metal parts of the
            routing/trimming tool to become electrified and shock the operator.
        3.  Ensure the machine is placed on a flat surface and in a well-ventilated 
            space before operation.
        4.  Always wear eye protection during machine operation.
        5.  Always wear hearing protection during extended machine operation based on 
            proximity to machine.
        6.  Materials may release chemicals that are toxic or unsafe to inhale when cut.
            Always check the Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) of the material in question
            before cutting. Always cover exposed skin and wear appropriate airway protection
            (e.g. dust mask/respirator) specific to the  material used and its application.
        7.  Any workpiece must be appropriately secured before starting a cutting routine
            by clamps or other practical securing method. Holding the material by hand or
            employing any any other unstable form of securing will lead to unsafe loss of
            machine control.
        8.  Cutting bits used for the Mill One should be used at the discretion of the user.
            Bits are sharp and can crack and break without notice so appropriate care should
            be taken by the user while manipulating and installing them. Carefully check bits
            for cracks or damage before operating the machine and replace any cracked or
            unfit bits immediately.
        9.  Carefully inspect any consumable material before use on the machine, any
            unforeseen inconsistency in material hardness or material quality may cause
            damage to the machine.
        10. Keep away from all moving parts during machine operation.
        11. Before beginning a cutting job, ensure the router/trimmer runs properly.
            Immediately disable the tool if visible vibration or wobble occurs, this might
            indicate a damaged tool or an improperly installed bit.
        12. Make sure the bit in not contacting the workpiece before the router/trimmer tool
            is turned on.
        13. Do not leave the machine running unattended, the machine should only be operated
            with the operator present.
        14. Do not touch the cutting bit immediately after use. It may be hot and could burn
            the operator.
        15. Use bits that are appropriate to the material and cutting speed used.
