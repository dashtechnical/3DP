We've made all of these files available to be used alongside our video
resources which are available on our YouTube page:

If you follow the videos "Preparing to make your first cuts on the Sienci
Mill One" and "Using Kiri:Moto to cut the CNSheep" it will demonstrate
how some of these files were made and how you can use them to get your
Sienci Mill One in running condition to start making things!

We'd like to give credit where it's due and thank Davision3d for creating 
Melt Face (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:651829) and making it freely
available. We made his model ("Melted Face.STL") available on our Git but
don't take responsibility for making it.
