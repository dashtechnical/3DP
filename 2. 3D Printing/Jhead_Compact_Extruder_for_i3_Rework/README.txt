# Summary

Prusa i3 Rework Jhead Compact Extruder for 1.75mm and 3mm filaments. Designs based on the Wade Extruder but much smaller.  

This Compact design came with new problems because of the shorten of the Jhead hotend. One that was very noticeable was the x-carriage distance to the glass, only 9 mm. Resulting in x-carriage catching the bulldog clips on the back and   

front of the heated bed when printing long prints. Solution: smaller clips on the sides. Another problem was that the Z-Axis Endstop needed to be lowered, this wasn't a big problem in my case because I'm using a [Adjustable Z-Axis Micro Endstop](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:544109) that attachs to the smooth rod. I just needed to slide it down a bit. Depending on your Z-Axis Endstop, check to make sure it can be lowered enough to accommodate this compact extruder before conmitting to installing it.  

Hardware that I used -  
Extruder Body:  

Wade's Hobbed Bolt M8 x 60mm, groove is in the center - 30mm.  
[Prusa Extruder Springs](https://ultimachine.com/content/prusa-extruder-springs) from Ulimachine.  

Guidler:  

2 version, one for 1.75 filaments, it uses M3x40 mm bolt and the other for 3mm filaments and it uses M3x50 mm bolt.   

Optional Step: I filed down the M8x20 mm grub to get the 608z ball bearing on the guildler as close to the hobbed bolt as possible, especially when printing 1.75mm flexible filaments. See pic.  

Jhead Clamp:  

2 - M3x30mm bolts, washers and nuts.  

Jhead Shroud:  

2 version, 40mm - used 1 - M3x15mm bolt & nut to attach shroud to extruder body and 4 - M3x20mm bolts & nuts to attach 40mm fan & i3 cover to shroud.  
Note: The way it's design, you'll need to attach shroud first before attaching the fan.  

30mm - used 1 - M3x15mm bolt & nut to attach shroud & 4x Plastfast30 3.0 x 16 screws to attach the fan to the fan shroud.  

50mm Fan Duct:  

5 - M3x20mm bolts & nuts  

Other printed parts used:  

[Large & Small Gears](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:18379)  
[Prusa i3 40mm Fan Cover](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:210215)  
[Open Hardware 50mm Fan Cover](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:210212)
