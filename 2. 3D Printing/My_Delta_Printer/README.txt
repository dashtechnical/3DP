# Summary

This is my delta printer! The design is based on the Kossel Mini (lots of cred!) but everything is redesigned to fit my needs. I wanted it to print fast, look good on my desk and be fairly cheap!  

Features (in addition to being a kossel/delta printer with what that brings):  
- Very rigid (bottom and top corner pieces have been reinforced withmore supporting material and extra fastening screws + 2020 extrusions are used instead of 1515)  
- Magnetic ball joints for minimal backlash and easy handling  
- Wires are fed through corner pieces, looks neat  
- Extruder is mounted on base extrusions so that the bowden tube can be packed together with effector cables.  
- Nema 17 motor with planetary gears is neatly integrated in the extruder design, for performance and looks   
- Effector, arm carriages and bed mounts are all designed to maximize the print height (which ends up in something like 275mm)  
- Snap on Z-probe (see my other thing: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:892398) 

If someone is seriously interested in making this I'll be happy to help out as much as possible. If you want a list of links with all parts I have bought, just let me know. I sourced most of the non-printed parts from China, and I think the total cost ends up somewhere around 350 USD (depending on your choice of "expensive" parts; extrusions, linear rails, motors).  

Overall it now prints great, compared to my Printrbot Simple Metal it is both faster and less noisy!

EDIT 15-10-12:  
- Here is an updated effector that uses a 40mm fan to cool both hot end and the printed part: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1050490
- If you'd rather use ball joints (will never come apart, but might have some play) I have designed this: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1015846
