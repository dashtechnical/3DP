# Summary

Different wheels for RC vehicles, was designed to fit Daniels cool OpenRC Truggy http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:42198 but as you can see in my pics/vids they will also fit others (with 12mm wheel hex nut)  For 17mm go here: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:970573  

Print the parts without support.  
I use 6pcs M4x25mm screws for each tire.   
  
Designed the first sets on the plane home from Shanghai to kill some time... I did not try them all out, I hope you can do that :-)  
Included some STEP files and a tire without the tracks so you can add your own...  

Check out my PI-ETPU 95-250 Carbon Black filament, it´s a professional 3D printer flexible and conductive filament
 
Don´t need the conductivity?

Well the conductivity is great for some things but perhaps not your first choice?  Then consider this:

This filament will give you some really nice benefits if the conductivity is not an disadvantage for your 3D printed design:

•The material composition eliminates “stringing / webbing” issues.
•The hardness of 95 shore A and the carbon black filler makes for great print abilities.
•The carbon black filler is an excellent UV stabilizer thus the prints are built to last in very harsh environments.
•The matte black surface finish has a very exclusive look.
•The material feels very nice and dry to touch.
•The elongation at break is only 250%.
