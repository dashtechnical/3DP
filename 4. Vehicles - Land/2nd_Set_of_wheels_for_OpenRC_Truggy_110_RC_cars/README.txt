18 new combinations... thus a total of 108 combinations (together with http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:526969) of wheels for 1:10 RC cars  

Designed to fit Daniels cool OpenRC Truggy http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:42198 but as you can see in my pics/vids they will also fit others (with 12mm wheel hex nut)  For 17mm go here: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:970573  

Print the parts without support.  
Tires optimized for 0.7mm nozzle  
I use 6pcs M4x25mm screws for each tire.  

In this release I have also included reinforcement parts based on an idea by http://www.thingiverse.com/SP3SWJ/about   Thanks Jaroslaw!  

Also check out my new rim/axle design here: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:965553  

In photos/video:  
Tires printed with conductive & flexible PI-ETPU 95-250 Carbon Black filament (I like how easy it is to print and the surface finish looks really nice)  http://rubber3dprinting.com/

and rims with conductive ABS: http://www.creativetools.se/eco-abs-1-75mm-conductive?filter_name=conductive%20abs  
Enjoy!  

Please also check out my unuiqe UV-stable, flexible and conductive filament called ETPU 95-250 Carbon Black filament.

Don´t need the conductivity? Well the conductivity is great for some things but perhaps not your first choice? Then consider this:

This filament will give you some really nice benefits if the conductivity is not an disadvantage for your 3D printed design:

•The material composition eliminates “stringing / webbing” issues.
•The hardness of 95 shore A and the carbon black filler makes for great print abilities.
•The carbon black filler is an excellent UV stabilizer thus the prints are built to last in very harsh environments.
•The matte black surface finish has a very exclusive look.
•The material feels very nice and dry to touch.
•It´s not too stretchy and will do great for timing belts etc.
