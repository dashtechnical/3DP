# Summary

There were a couple of models out there for the 10th doctors screwdriver, but I wasn't entirely on board with any of them out there, plus I really liked the way that Ellindsey did the 11th doctor's screwdriver (thing:169870) in that each part could be printed with a different color filament and could then be assembled into a prop without painting.  Also I plan to wire it up with an LED and a button on the side or bottom.  The files currently have a hollow center for the wiring, once I find a suitable button ill alter some piece of the screwdriver to house it and upload the new part.  

Also this can easily be the 9th doctor's sonic screwdriver with a color change either through printing in different colors or painting differently  

**UPDATE** I have printed it out as of now and it went great.  Although painting is not necessary for this part (if you have all the colors) I painted the gray parts with some silver paint to give it a bit more of a metallic look.  Also I wound up re-sizing the clear inner housing to make sure it slid easily through the screwdriver.  I have uploaded the new file.  All should be good to go.  

**UPDATE2**  In other news I have decided to make all the past versions of the Doctor's Sonic Screwdrivers say maybe one a week until they are completed so stay tuned :)

**UPDATE3 --- 3/14/17 ---**  Some have had issues printing the inner clear piece of the screwdriver (drw10scr-insd.stl)  It appears this is mainly due to wall thickness and what your printer is tuned to be able to print, or extruding diameter.  Therefore I have uploaded a version 2 of that file with a tad thicker walls to hopefully get around that issue for those that are having a problem.  **look for drw10scr-insd-V2**

# Instructions

Rep 2, PLA, .2 mm layer height, 2 shell 20% fill, no rafts or supports.  

once all parts are printed I assembled as such:  
glued lens to top of inside2.  
slid the above assembly into the top and glued.  
slid the bottom2 onto bottom1  
glued the above assembly onto body  
slid the clear inner onto the top/inner2 assembly and glued.  
slid the top assembly into the body  
glued the slider into the hole in the clear inner.  

All done!
