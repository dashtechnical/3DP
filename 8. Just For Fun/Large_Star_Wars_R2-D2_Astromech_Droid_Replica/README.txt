# Summary

This is a nearly 1/4 scale size replica of the famous R2-D2 droid from Star Wars, designed to be assembled from components which will all fit in a 3D printer with a 120x120x120mm build volume. It was designed to be as detailed as possible, and has moveable legs and head. The center leg even retracts inside the body. This droid also has a secret ability that is revealed in this short video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2a_4KQzSl2k

# Post-Printing

You can sand and paint this droid like any other plastic model kit. Use a color scheme from the films, or come up with your own ideas. 

# How I Designed This

This model was designed completely from scratch, to get experience designing detailed and articulated models intended for FDM 3D printing. It was designed using Alibre 2011, and the models were rotated to optimal build orientation using Meshmixer.
