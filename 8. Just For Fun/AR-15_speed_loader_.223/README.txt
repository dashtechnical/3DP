# Summary

10 round speed loader for AR-15 magazines, designed for .223 rounds. Improvements over other versions on here are better fit, more accurate feeding.
When loading the bullets, tilt speed loader and magazine slightly, so the bullet side is slightly lower - that way you avoid rounds flipping when dropping down.

Here's a time lapse video of one being printed (0.2mm, 50% fill, 6 level shell). Took 10 hrs:  youtu.be/KBwacWpHbKE

Update 01/12/17
I received a request for a 5rd version which has been added.

Update 03/13/16
I was told that when printing with some material, the shrinkage actually leads to the funnel being under COL max for the .223 round, so this revision has an increased width (initial design was 2.270, now it is 2.310). Should not be an issue with most ammo, but when you got above 2.240, there was a chance for stuck rounds...

Update 09/09/17
I received a request for a 30rd version which has been added. I highly doubt that this is a workable solution, most likely will not fit any printer to begin with, but hey, it took 2 minutes to adjust the design, so here it is. (I personally will not print/test it)


I also switched to 4 shells and 100% infill - it is so much more sturdy "unbreakable" and barely more expensive/time consuming


# Print Settings

Printer: Microcenter clone
Rafts: No
Supports: No
Resolution: as you like .2 is nice and smooth
Infill: 20%

Notes: 
No support or raft needed. Print the housing part with the wider part upside for best results.
While the 20% technically works, day to day usage is better with a 100% solid ram (or simply print both parts 100% solid...), the rams with the lower fill rate have a tendency to break.
