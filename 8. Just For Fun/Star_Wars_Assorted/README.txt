# Summary

A few weeks ago a 3D artist who actually worked on the Star Wars movie released a library of Star Wars 3D models on reddit. However, he warned these model files were from a 3d sculpting program and haven't been optimized for 3d printing. Well I brought them through netfabb aka the stl first aid kit and now I think they're ready. Enjoy, I have all of the files, these are just the ones I've optimized so far.
