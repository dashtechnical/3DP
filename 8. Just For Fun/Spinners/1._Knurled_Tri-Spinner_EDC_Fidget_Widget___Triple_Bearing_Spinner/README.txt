**EDIT 12/5/16: The Peg Cap has been replaced with a new version that should work a little better! If it doesn't work, try resizing slightly on the X/Y axis depending on your printer!**

Our second fidget spinner! These are a ton of fun to play with, and we definitely intend to release several more models as we iterate on this design. We made the design in OpenSCAD, so the original parametric model can be easily modified.

This version of the Tri-Spinner has knurling all around the sides to make it a little easier to grip with one hand.

This spinner has a peg cap, which allows you to to grip the spinner with a pinch grip, and also spin it like a top! We didn't see a similar design yet, so it seemed like a cool addition!

Just print it out and add four [608 bearings](http://amzn.to/2fmW1el); one for the center spinner, and three for added mass around the sides!
