# Summary

Ciao a tutti,
Hello everybody,

GASB 1.0 a very simple printable flying wing.

The wingspan of this model is 80cm (31,5 inch). The parts of the model are able to fit into a standard 3D printer (19x19x16cm work size). The key points of this design are: very few pieces to be printed (9), cheapness (about 300g of PLA), easy assembly (only CA glue) and good flier!

History:
- On July 31th 2016 over the field of GASB in Padulle the flying wing version 4 flew. The first four takeoff attempts was spent to find the CG. This is located 145mm rear to the junction leading edges of the wings. As soon found the CG, the plane took off twice by beautiful flights. The final weight of the version 4 was 334g with all (battery, motor, receiver etc,,,). 
- The version 5 was a little heavier (358g) due the increment of the thickness to 0.32mm instead 0.3mm, the infill 3% instead 2% and canopy fixed by magnets. The weight was increased but the motor is able to manage properly. Was downloaded by over 10000 people. Downloadable here: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2320788

Version 6 available for download. The improvements are show here https://www.thingiverse.com/make:347302
