# Summary

Deck out your Flite Test Mini Arrow with this awesome power pod! It has a hatch on top for accessing your fpv gear and battery, a built in mount for your fpv camera and mounting holes for either a straight or 90 degree fpv antenna. This power pod will also fit a 3s 1300 battery and the front nose piece is removable so you can take out your fpv gear when flying los.

Tested to fit a battery measuring 70x35x20mm. Will fit most 3S 1300's!

Accepts board cameras up to 33x33mm with mounting hole spacing up to 28x28mm.

Motor mounting holes measure 14 to 21mm diagonally and have been verified to fit 2204 motors. Other motors will fit as well including 2208 and 2212.

To print I recommend standing the two main pieces on end as they are in the files with 15% support on the fpv pod and no support is needed on the main pod.
