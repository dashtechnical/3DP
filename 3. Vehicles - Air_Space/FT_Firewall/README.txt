# Summary

My attempt to reconfigure the FT Firewall to suit a variety of different motor mounting layouts.

It's about twice as thick compared to one made out of hobby plywood, however I believe it is more rigid and strong. 

Print it how you like/ to your specific printer settings. I have just added what my settings were.

# Print Settings

Rafts: No
Supports: No
Resolution: 90%
Infill: No

Notes: 
Probably could make it with less infill, I just wanted to play it safe and make it as solid as possible. Don't really want to test how thin I can safely go.
