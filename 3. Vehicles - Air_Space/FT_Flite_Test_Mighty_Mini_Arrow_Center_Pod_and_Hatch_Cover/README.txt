# Summary

A 3D-printable version of the center pod and hatch cover for the Mini Arrow by Flite Test:
http://store.flitetest.com/ft-mighty-mini-arrow/

You will want to print the center pod with only one or two shells and 10% fill, otherwise it will be stupidly heavy. The benefit of using the printed version is that it has thinner walls than the foam version, thus allowing the use of a wider battery (up to 35mm) without having to redesign the rest of the plane. The back side of the pod has a standard internal width to accept the stock power pod. It also has two small knobs that not only act as friction points for the foam pod, but they are also placed to lock into the printable power pods by AustinSaintAubin found here:

The hatch cover is intended to be printed in something flexible and hot-glued in place like the original. It wraps around under the plane as a mini skid guard. It can be secured at the back of the plane with Velcro as it overlaps the top of the canopy by about an inch, or you can simply tape it closed.

Please note, the stock foam hatch cover should still work if you prefer it.
