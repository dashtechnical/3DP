This is my customized Flitetest FT Mini Arrow center pod. I'm no expert at this, but I'm pretty happy with the result. It's very much a work in progress, so feel free to suggest modifications.

I print on a small MonoPrice Select Mini 3D Printer, so I have to deal with a small print bed.
This was designed to fit that small print bed (hence why it's chopped in 1/2).

This was designed to carry the small TX01/02 cameras/transmitters, but should be able to accommodate most any small board camera.

I want to give credit to http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1395296 and http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1904465 since I used their designs as inspiration.

I print these in PLA with...
 - Layer Height: 0.1mm
 - Shell Thickness: 0.8mm
 - Top/Bottom Thickness: 0.4mm
 - Fill Density: 10%

Any suggestions or comments, let me know.
