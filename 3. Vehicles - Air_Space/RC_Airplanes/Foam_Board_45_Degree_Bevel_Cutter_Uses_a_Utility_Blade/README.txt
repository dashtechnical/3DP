# Summary

Update 3-14-16: I've added Bevel Top 1.3 which cuts a little deeper just in case version 1.2 doesn't cut well enough for your liking.

This 45 degree bevel cutter uses standard utility blades and was designed to be used on dollar tree foam board. It works great for cutting bevels for folds and hinges for control surfaces!

This bevel cutter is designed to use 3 M3x10mm screws.

I suggest printing this with 10% infill and 10% support.

If you have any suggestions for tweaks or modifications please let me know!
