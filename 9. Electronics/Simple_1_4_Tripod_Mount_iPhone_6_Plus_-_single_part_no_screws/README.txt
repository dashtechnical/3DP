Simple 1/4 Tripod Mount iPhone 6 Plus - single part no screws by Meister is licensed under the Creative Commons - Attribution license.

# Summary

Inspired by - see remix - I have created a new version from scratch that actually fits a iPhone 6 Plus with the original Apple Leather Case.

I created it for studio work with my iPhone. It does 240 FPS for slow motion effects. This is a nice extension to my Nikon which is limited to 60 FPS. It works great on my tripod. You can even align the mount point with the side optical axis.

Disclaimer: The mount is not meat for action style outdoor activities since the grip might not be strong enough for holding the iPhone securely. 

# Print Settings

Printer Brand: Up!
Printer: Up Mini
Rafts: Doesn't Matter
Supports: No
Resolution: 0.3 mm layer
Infill: loose - 30%

Notes: 
Print it oriented as is on the side with no support. The 1/4 inch standard thread should print fine. On my printer it is a strong fit for the tripod screw and it holds well.

The material I used is PLA with Aluminium infusion, so it makes a nice finish. However PLA is rather scratchy to the leather, so use sanding or a file on the mount to make it soft.
