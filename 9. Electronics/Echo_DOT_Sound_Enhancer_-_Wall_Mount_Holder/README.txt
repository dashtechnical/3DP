# Summary

This is a multi use Mount/Stand for the Amazon Dot 2. It has a curved lower section to redirect the sound out from under the unit to enhance the sound. I tested this with my unit and it seems to work well. Thought he sounds does not seem to have a major change when sitting on a hard surface, it does prevent the muffling of the sound when the unit is sitting on something soft, such as  a fabric table covering. The Alexa Dot fits securely into the top allowing you to mount this in a multitude of way. I left space on the bottom to allow for the use of small rubber feet, and holes to allow mounting using screws. You can place this on you desk or mount it on your wall. It's all up to you. One of my units is mounted on the wall near my Spa (more than 5' away) to allow me to have control over my lighting and music without having to worry about mixing water and electric.

It is my understanding that Dot 1.0 has the same lateral dimensions as 2.0. If so, you should be able to use this with that model as well. Doing so would result in the side spikes not entirely reaching all the way to the top of the unit, but I see no reason why it would not work.

# Print Settings

Printer Brand: MakerBot
Printer: MakerBot Replicator 2
Rafts: No
Supports: No
Resolution: 100
Infill: 15%

Notes: 
I printed the pictured one using 100/layer, but it would look fine at 200/layer. I wanted a really nice finish and time was not an issue for the print.

# How I Designed This

This was deigned using TinkerCad. It is similar to others out there, but was designed from the ground up to allow for a multitude of small changes including screw holes, elliptical sound reflector, feet placements, art-deco design.It is matched to the new Echo DOT 2.0 dimensions.
