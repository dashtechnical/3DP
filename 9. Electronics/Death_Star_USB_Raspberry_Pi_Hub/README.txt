# Summary

This is a Raspberry Pi or USB Hub Modeled after DS1 with a few inspirations for the trenches from similar models. I personally use this as a Raspberry Pi Zero powered Console server at work. The entire model has been built from scratch using Fusion 360, and the files are included if anyone wishes to edit/remix.

Print all the parts as oriented, with supports for the 90 degree overhangs on a few parts. For the USB hubs, I used a few generic 4 port wired hubs from Amazon, and cut away the shells. The grooves on the trench plates should have the metal edges slide in nicely. Secure the 2 trench plates together by snapping them together, or with 3mm screws/bolts if you use the old bolt trench patterns. Place a USB cable in the groove on the Power Plug pieces, and then screw it into the bottom.

For a bit of extra flare, I used a woodburning kit to poke a hole in the dish, and insert a green LED using the "Light Tube" and "Light Tube Cap". You must glue the light tube to line up with the hole you make. Looks really nice if plugged into the 5V on the Pi! The pictures are from an earlier version, the Dish on the released version is solid and one piece with the top half of the globe.

Additional Note: The "Scale 75%" files are for if you want to print a smaller version. You have to scale all the other parts down 75% in your slicer software, but these pieces will fit perfectly without any scaling into the rest of a 75% scaled model.
