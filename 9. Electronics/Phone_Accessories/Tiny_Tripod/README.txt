# Summary

A very small tripod suitable for an iPhone 6, with or without a case. Will probably work with other cell phones, as long as they’re not too thick or too heavy. Consists of three parts: Tiny Links (you’ll need to print at least 18 to duplicate the picture), Tiny Holder (print one) and Tiny Tripod (print one). The Tiny Tripod connects all the parts: they snap together.

The Tiny Links are useful for other creative fastening projects. They click together to make a round chain that can be gently flexed into necklaces or decorative ropes.
