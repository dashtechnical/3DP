# Summary

I purchased an Amazon Echo Dot before Thanksgiving and decided to make a holder for it because I was told that it had poor audio (as compared to the full size Amazon Echo) and I wanted to give it an ability to disperse the sound better than just sitting on the counter. My inspiration was from maker CallJoe and his Echo Dot Acoustic Stand (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1687425).  I designed my holder from scratch and it is not a remix of CallJoe's.  Though I know CallJoe personally (a really good maker) and thought of remixing his design but I wanted the challenge of doing this myself.  I used Sketchup 2016 Pro for modeling and STL generation but you could probably use the free version and generate similar results.  It took a few tries to get things right for my Monoprice Maker Select Min but it worked out great.

I designed it to have a decent enough of a footprint on the base but hollowed out the center underside with a dome to lighten the design and have less print material. I think the "fingers" are decent and it has held up for a month now with no issues but being printed in PLA the "fingers" could most likely break pretty easy if it were to be dropped.

I printed this in black PLA at 205C with a bed temp of 50C on blue tape and light coat of hairspray.  No raft or brim was needed but your mileage may vary.  I would print this again with ABS or PETG but will probably redesign the holder to make the "fingers" stronger when printed due to typical printing being flat.  I guess you could print this on its side to make the layers "vertical" when finished printing by using supports but that would be a lot of supports.

If you like it please give it a like and if you download and print it I hope you enjoy it.
