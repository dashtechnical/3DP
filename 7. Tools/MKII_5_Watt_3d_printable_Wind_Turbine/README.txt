# Summary

https://youtu.be/_NhGP7Bfk18
MKII 5 Watt 3d printable Wind Turbine with passive variable pitch mechanism. All Printable parts can be printed without the use of supports minimising post processing.

https://youtu.be/rkLW1EaWEb0 Before the Flood - the aim is to reduce my carbon footprint 1 Renewable Watt at a time whilst giving others the same opportunity without the burden of the design, testing, manufacture and optimisation of this complex Turbine.

Description
The MkII has three design improvements, the first is an all important tail fin to allow the turbine to turn into the wind and extract the maximum wind energy in changeable conditions, the second is a stiffer tower structure with bigger bearings and increased diameter locating pin to support the increased loads from the tail whilst allowing for the third improvement which is the inclusion of Split Ring Electronics. The Split Ring Electronics allows the turbine to spin around the tower axis without any limitations it brings the power electronics into the tower where there is more space and its easier to access.

This fully functional wind turbine has been specifically design to be manufactured, assembled and operated at home with its unique 3d printable design. The wind turbine is optimized to produce a power output of 5 Watt (12volt ~0.4amps) at 5m/s wind speeds, perfect for battery charging applications.

The wind turbine has been designed with a unique Passive Variable Pitch (PVP) design. The PVP maintains an optimum power output through control of the turbines rotational speed. Whilst optimizing power output the PVP also protects the Turbine from dangerous over speed conditions, limiting its maximum revolutions per minute in wind speeds greater than 5m/s.

The main components of the turbine have been designed for Additive Layer Manufacturing (ALM) methods using PLA plastic. 95% of the ALM components require no post processing as these parts do not require ‘print supports’ reducing material usage whilst improving the overall finish of the part.

UPGRADES
If you search "mkII 5 watt 3d printable wind turbine" on google you will find some upgraded parts for the wind turbine things like:

-Blade split into two parts for easy printing
-2GT Belt drive option for reduced noise and higher gear ratios
-A protective cover for the Shaft Nut to ensure no rotating items contact the electrics
-An alternate Tower header diameter and slip ring assembly design for a smaller diameter tower pole

You will also find some pictures/videos and general discussion and advice on printing, assembly and operation.

Thanks Dan

# Print Settings

Printer Brand: Ultimaker
Printer: Ultimaker 2
Rafts: No
Supports: No

Notes: 
Contact me if you require a printing service.

Materials, Speeds and Feeds, Temperatures, Infill and layer settings are listed in the Instruction Manual. The assembly has been specifically design for these settings, printing outside of these setting may affect the fit, form and function of the turbine.

Rotor Assy - there should be 6xM3 machine screws called out as item 14 in the lower right view and then 3xM4 self tapping screws in the upper view attaching the nose cone to the disc. Sorry I made a last minute change and didn't catch this...

Wind Turbine Assy - the 2xM3 Self tapping screws should be M4 Self tapping screws.
