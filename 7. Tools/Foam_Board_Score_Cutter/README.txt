# Summary

This cutter uses standard utility blades and was designed to be used on dollar tree foam board. With an open side to easily run along the side of your straight edge, this cutter takes the guesswork out of score cuts by giving you a perfect cut at the right depth every time! 

This foam board cutter is designed to use 1 M3x10mm screw.

I suggest printing this with 10% infill and 10% support.

If you have any suggestions for tweaks or modifications please let me know!

Like all my other uploads, this item is also for sale on my website at http://RcPartsHangar.com.
