# Summary

This cutter uses standard utility blades and was designed to be used on dollar tree foam board. Specifically designed to make channel cuts for 'A' and 'B' folds, this cutter will make a perfectly spaced channel cut every time!

This foam board cutter is designed to use 1 M3x10mm screw.

I suggest printing this with 10% infill and 10% support.

If you have any suggestions for tweaks or modifications please let me know!

Like all my other uploads, this item is also for sale on my website at http://RcPartsHangar.com.
