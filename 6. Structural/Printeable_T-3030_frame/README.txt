# Summary

I saw this thing (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2137913) and thought, what about the 3030 version? Would be it any better? Well, since I didn't find it, it is here now. 

Just modified the original SCAD file to make 3030 profiles based on this one: https://es.aliexpress.com/item/Customized-3030W-Aluminum-Extrusion-Profile-Free-cutting-in-any-Length-Black-Color/32799761497.html?spm=2114.13010608.0.0.GpQMwK

It has the same features as the 2020 version so I guess you will have no problems in using it. Also, included a 30mm tall version stl of the top, mid and bottom of the profile, if you join them you'll have a 90mm profile. I like these cause it takes less than 2 hours to print them.

For joining them I use ABS glue or Slurry in some cases: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:14490
