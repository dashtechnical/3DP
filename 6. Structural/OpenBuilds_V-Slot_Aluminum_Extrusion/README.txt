# Summary

OpenBuilds V-Slot™ Modular Framing System  
=========================  
###V-Slot is an Open Source, high quality extruded aluminum profile building block that has an extremely smooth linear v groove rail on all 4 sides.  It's precise, easy to work with and allows you unlimited design control through it's modular nature.  
V-Slot's building characteristics are much like traditional T-Slot but V-Slot then goes on to add new levels of functionality through it's internal v grooves that allow for linear motion.  
V-Slot is compatible with readily available, off the shelf, T-Slot components!  

OpenBuilds™ Parts are now available in many easy to use and share formats!   
Including STEP / IGES / SolidWorks / SketchUp Please see the OpenBuilds Parts Resource section here to grab'em. http://www.openbuilds.com/resources/categories/openbuilds-parts.5/  
Thank you and all the best with your builds!

###V-Slot easily and quickly allows for creating mechanical assembly's and motion control systems for just about any type of platform you can imagine!

# Instructions

##UPDATE - New file to download. SketchUp model includes examples of OpenRail mounted to the V-Slot Framing system. As well as the latest plate and wheel models. Enjoy!  
  
Building with V-Slot is much like working with lumber.  
You can cut it with a chop saw, and simply just bolt together using a screwdriver. And it is compatible with readily available T-Slot components.  
"V-Slot can be used for most projects, such as 3D printers, CNC engravers, laser cutters, camera sliders, robotics and furniture. It could increase functionality of your design and drive down the cost of projects as well as the assembly time."  

Download the SketchUp model files to design your own machines before you build them.
