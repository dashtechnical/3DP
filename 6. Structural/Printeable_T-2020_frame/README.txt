# Summary

I saw this thing and thought we need a customizer version of this frame.
http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1961848

Please see the full description on his thing.

I made a small change to the pin hole so it might fit better on a printer with a bit of back lash artifact in the corners.

Features:
1. Give it the length of the T-Frame and build higet of your printer and it will output a set of frames to glue together.
2. Change the tolerance value to make the pin and hole fit better on your printer.
3. It will auto place the T-Frames.
4. (Not implemented yet) Give it the size of the build plate to place the T-Frames better. For now it will just put them in a square.
