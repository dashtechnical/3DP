Extrusion Corner Plate Brackets for 2020, 2525, 3030, or 4040 by idig3d is licensed under the Creative Commons - Attribution - Non-Commercial - No Derivatives license.

# Summary

Extrusion corner brackets with built-in plates. Short and tall versions for 2020, 3030, and 4040 extruded aluminum -- and now with 2525. Print three of each for each corner. 

I like to break things down to essential patterns and make things printable without support. Also, I try to incorporate orientation for making the strongest parts.

By printing them in three parts, it should reduce the print time about 10-15% or much more since you can print without supports. Printing them flat this way should also give greater strength in all directions since the part is rotated for each corner direction.

2020 and 2525 have M5 holes and 5mm thick.
3030 and 4040 have M8 holes and are 6mm thick. 

This is currently experimental and open to suggestions.

# Print Settings

Printer: Creality CR-10
Rafts: No
Supports: No
Resolution: 0.2-0.24 mm
Infill: 25-60% -- 3 or more outlines

Notes: 
Print in groups of 3 for each corner. They should print flat and then join all together. It is designed with a 0.2mm offset that works well for most of my printers.

The more outlines/perimeters and denser the infill, the stronger they should be.
